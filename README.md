## Front-End Web Development v2.1

Welcome to the FEWD Curriculum v2.1! To see what's new in v2.1, see [this change log](change-log.md).

This repository contains all the materials GA supplies its Front-End Web Development instructors. Bear in mind that __many of the files in this repo are meant to be instructor-facing only__. See [the corresponding FEWD repo template](https://github.com/ga-students/FEWD-Student-Facing-Repo-Template), located in the ga-students GitHub org, for instructions on how to set up a student-facing repository for your class.  

General Assembly's Front-End Web Development (FEWD) course is made up of 20 lessons that are 3 hours each. This course is split into 3 week units.

*	Unit 1: HTML/CSS Basics
*	Unit 2: Adding Interactivity
*	Unit 3: Building In Concert

For a schedule of all lessons and notes on the materials provided for each lesson, please see [the sample schedule](schedule.md).

### Pre-Course Responsibilities

We __highly recommend__ you begin preparing your lessons before the course starts. You should start prepping to teach the materials 4 - 6 weeks prior to course launch. A good benchmark is to prepare the first 5 - 6 lessons before the course begins.

During these preparation weeks you should:

*	Update the slide decks for each lesson to correspond with what you plan to teach.

*	Review the sample and solution code for each lesson and assignment and make sure you agree with the way it was coded. If not, you can always make tweaks to the code. Keep in mind the students' level of understanding but __don't share code you don't agree with__.

*	Review all curriculum materials and think about how you would like to apply your teaching style and professional experience to the classroom.


## Available Materials

We've supplied a folder for each week and lesson. In these folders we've included:

|Materials | Description | How to Use It|
|----|---------|---------------|
| __README.md__| Topic break down and suggested schedule. | Use this to get a high level view of the week, including information on the lesson plan, in-class exercises, assignments and final project milestones.|
| __Slides__| Markdown file with slide content.| Customize each deck before sharing with students (more on that during the on-boarding meeting with your producer). We suggest using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) to present slides to the class. Be sure to maintain the same folder structure so that the relative image paths still work.|
| __Code Alongs__| Code to be used by instructors to help demonstrate a concept.|These are exercises where you'll demonstrate a concept in class while students follow along on their machines. Type slowly and explain the concepts, pausing at regular intervals to check for understanding.|
| __Exercises__|Code examples for in-class exercises.| Be sure to read all of the instructions and solution files in advance, so that you are able to answer any questions students might have.|
| __Starter Code Folder__| This is a folder with all the starter code students need for that lesson.| You should share this folder with students before every lesson. Make the necessary changes if you are using different code.|
| __Solution Folder__| This is a folder with all solutions to code alongs and exercises| Share individual solution files as needed. Student should be provided with code demo solutions before lab time to use as a reference.|
| __Assignments__| Exercises to be completed outside of class. | Each assignment folder contains the assignment prompt, starter code, solution code and a grading rubric.|

### How To Prepare For Each Lesson

1.	Read the weekly README, and take a look at the weekly assignment.

2.	Review the lesson agenda schedule and learning objectives. Become familiar with what we would like students to accomplish during a particular lesson.

3.	Dive into the lesson planning notes.

4.	View the solution file, and make sure you agree with the solutions. If you don't, change it before you share with students. Students want to feel like you are in command of all materials you share with them.

5.	Decide how you will bring your expertise to the classroom and what materials you will have to edit in order to incorporate any additions or changes you are planning to make to the lesson.

6.	Use The Slide Deck To Determine lesson flow. The slides.md files we provide are meant to serve as a baseline. Be sure to update the slides to fit the lessons as you intend to teach them. If you prefer not to use slides, you can use the markdown files for the slides to help you plan the flow of each class.

7.	If you prefer not to use the GA-provided code alongs/in-class exercises, create your own and make sure they hit the same topics and learning objectives for that lesson. If you do build new exercises, please share your work with the curriculum team, either [via email](mailto:askpart-time@ga.co) or by sending a pull-request to this repo. We are actively working to build the best curriculum we can and are always happy to consider contributions from instructors!

8.	Practice using reveal.js. It can be tricky to get the hang of the workflow (see below).

### Slides

*	We suggest using reveal.js with external markdown.

*	Any text following the line `Note:` in a given slide will not appear in the presented deck. However, when you share the rendered markdown (i.e as a pdf), students will see the notes. This is a great place to put presenter notes and additional information you would like students to read outside of class.

*	See [here](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) for further documentation about reveal.js.

The slides we provide are a skeletal deck and require your customization! If there are slides you do not agree with, you can update them. If you want to introduce topics in a different order, feel free to reorder them.


## Assignments and Projects

In order to pass this course General Assembly students must:

*	Complete and submit 80% of all course homework assignments.

	*	Students will receive feedback from instructors on their assignments within 2 - 4 days.

*	Complete and submit the course [final project](Final_Project/final_project_requirements.md), including all milestones.

## Grading, Hosting and Using GitHub in the Classroom

In FEWD, we use GitHub for student-facing materials, homework submission, final project hosting, feedback and grading.

* **Do not attempt to teach Git and GitHub using the command line!** Please see the [GitHub lesson](Week_00_GitHub/) for recommended tools and teaching strategies.

* Students will learn GitHub as part of the [pre-work](Pre_Work/) and via the modular [GitHub lesson](Week_00_GitHub/). If your instance schedules a class 0, the instructor can teach the concepts included in the GitHub lesson in class 0. Otherwise, the GitHub lesson should be taught as part of either Lesson 1 or 2.

* For guidance on the homework submission, grading and feedback workflow using GitHub, please see the [GitHub_Grading_Workflow](Week_00_GitHub/GitHub_Grading_Workflow.md) doc.
