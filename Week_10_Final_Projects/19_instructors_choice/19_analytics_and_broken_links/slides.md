## Review

---

##What are Analytics

And Why Do We Care?

---

##How to Use Analytics

Nothing is better than watching the choices of actual consumers.

---

##Metrics

* Pageviews
* Sessions
* Users
* Events

---

##Pageview

* A page view is when a specific url is loaded in the browser
* By default url uniqueness includes query string variables
	* /product/d810SLR
	* is different from /product/d801SLR?partnerID=34
* By default UTM values are excluded from uniqueness

---

##Session

* A session is when a user sits down and views pages on the website
* Sessions are key in tracking the user flow

---

##User

* In theory: A unique person
* Why are user counts not always representative of real humans?


--- 

##User

* In theory: A unique person
* Why are user counts not always representative of real humans?
	* Bots
	* Multiple browsers
	* Multiple computers (or locations)
	* Cleared cookies
	* Cellular devices




---

##Events

* Events are actions recorded where the user does not reload the page
	- Click
	- Hover (such as moving the mouse over a menu)
	- Something has loaded
	- Something DIDN’T load
* Why on earth do I need these?

#The Tracking 'Pixel' / Tag

Analytics gathers data by loading a script or image from a server from the analytics service.

---

#Google Analytics

---

#Installing the Tracking Pixel

* Sign up for Google Analytics at http://www.google.com/analytics
* Create a Property (website)
* Configure Property Settings
	* Referral Excludes
	* Tracking Options
* Filter out office traffic (Optional)
* Install Tracking Script on Website

---

#Installing the Tracking Pixel

* The Google Analytics script must be on every page tracked.

---

#Tracking ID 

* The tracking ID is the unique ID of your property that Google Analytics uses to collect data.
* A single Google Analytics account (and brand for that matter) can have many properties
* Often nicknamed the “UA code”

##Example: UA-167902719-3
