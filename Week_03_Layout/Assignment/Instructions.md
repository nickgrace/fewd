# FEWD Week #3: Layouts In Practice

---

###Description

In this assignment a federal client has made a last-minute request for a flat microsite.  The designer has created a full PDF mockup of the desired output and the content team has created a .txt file of the desired text.  Your task is to turn these materials into a 3-page html/css microsite.

Notes:

* On the resources pages, the content team does not yet have the real links available.  Use href="#" for links not yet defined.
* Handy Colors:
    Purple: #99216b
    Green: #00ff00
    Blue: #305ba9
* This uses a special font with a css available at: https://cloud.typography.com/7167134/7052352/css/fonts.css
* The font family is: "Whitney A", "Whitney B", sans-serif
* The general design is 1260px wide
* The bullets are using images for bullets. Look up the "list-style-image" property

Preview for the Future:
You may have noticed that there are two solutions in the folder.  The regular solution and the 'responsive' one.  For this assignment, you do NOT need to make the pages responsive or mobile friendly.  However, when this page was built for the client it had to be made responsive.  Take a look at the extra CSS.
